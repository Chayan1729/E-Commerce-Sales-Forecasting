# E-Commerce Sales Analysis & Forecasting  

This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce sales data and forecasting future trends to provide actionable insights for targeted marketing and business planning. The project involved data cleaning, exploratory analysis, customer segmentation, and sales forecasting using advanced statistical and machine learning models.  

## Project Objectives  
- Analyze e-commerce sales data to uncover key trends and patterns.  
- Prepare customer-centric data for clustering and segmentation.  
- Develop customer personas to support targeted marketing strategies.  
- Forecast future sales trends using historical data.  

## Key Features  

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Conducted in-depth analysis using visualizations like treemaps, pie charts, and bar charts to identify:  
  - Top-selling products.  
  - Seasonal trends and patterns.  
  - Key customer preferences.  

### Data Preprocessing  
- Performed data cleaning and feature engineering to improve data quality.  
- Used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and retain critical information for clustering algorithms.  

### Customer Segmentation  
- Applied clustering algorithms to segment customers into groups based on purchasing behavior.  
- Determined the optimal number of clusters using:  
  - **Elbow Method**  
  - **Silhouette Method**  
  - **Davies-Bouldin Index**  
- Created customer personas based on factors like profit contribution, discount preferences, and shipping choices for effective marketing.  

### Sales Forecasting  
- Implemented time-series forecasting models to predict future sales trends:  
  - **SARIMAX Model**: Captured seasonal trends and external influences.  
  - **Prophet Model**: Provided intuitive results for trend and seasonality analysis.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy  
  - Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  
  - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn  
  - Forecasting: statsmodels (SARIMAX), Prophet  
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook  

## Results  
- Identified critical customer segments and developed targeted marketing strategies.  
- Predicted future sales trends with high accuracy to inform inventory and business planning.  
- Gained actionable insights into profit margins, discount policies, and customer preferences.
